#
# On Windows ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "<AppData>\***unknown variable appname***" where <AppData> is user's
# value of "AppData" key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
# and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "<Local AppData>\NetBeans\Cache" where <Local AppData> is user's
# value of "Local AppData" key in Windows Registry under
# "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders"
#
# On Mac ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/Library/Application Support/***unknown variable appname***" and
# ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/Library/Caches/***unknown variable appname***"
#
# On other systems ${DEFAULT_USERDIR_ROOT} will be replaced by the launcher
# with "~/.***unknown variable appname***" and ${DEFAULT_CACHEDIR_ROOT} with "~/.cache/***unknown variable appname***"
#
# You can also use ${HOME} variable which will be replaced with
# user.home JVM system property value. This variable is valid only in
# default_userdir and default_cachedir properties.
#
# NOTE: If you specify a non-default userdir path on command line
# (--userdir option) and don't specify a cachedir path (--cachedir option),
# cachedir will be in "<userdir>/var/cache".

# Options used by the launcher by default:
# (can be overridden by explicit command line switches)
#
# Note that default -Xmx is selected for you automatically.
# You can find these values in var/log/messages.log file in your userdir.
# The automatically selected value can be overridden by specifying -J-Xmx
# here or on the command line.
#
# If you specify the heap size explicitly, you may also want to enable
# Concurrent Mark & Sweep garbage collector.
# (see http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqGCPauses)
#
# In the following default_options line, the -J-Xmx option specifying the max heap 
# space (the max amount of memory MPLAB X can use) is not included. This is because the JRE itself will look at 
# the environment where it is being run and will select an appropriate value. This value is typically 1/4 of the 
# max amount of memory in the system. If you want to allocate a larger value for the amount of memory
# you can add -J-XmxVALUE. For example, -J-Xmx4096m will make the upper limit be 4 gigabytes.
